<h2>Description</h2>
<p>NomNoms is our group’s improvement on Yelp. We didn’t like how impersonal Yelp is, and so sought to create a site where restaurant owners can directly add their restaurants to the site, with users then being able to browse through these restaurants and view the owner’s mentions, along with fellow users’ ratings and comments, to decide where they want to eat.</p>

<h2>Features</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Signup/Login for users and restaurant owners. Upon signup restaurant owners are asked to provide information about their restaurant which will be stored in the backend</li>
  <li>Live search bar to find restaurants by name</li>
  <li>Rating system that allows each user to give a restaurant a rating up to 5 stars. The average rating among all users is displayed</li>
  <li>Comments can be made for each restaurant so that all other users can see</li>
  <li>Restaurants can be filtered and viewed through characteristic tags</li>
  <li>Restaurant information such as address, phone number, characteristic tags, website link, and provided image are displayed to the user within each restaurant card</li>
</ol>

<h2>Getting Started</h2>
<p>Before we begin, make sure to have git installed</p>

<p> To retrieve the code locally, we are going to have to clone the repository to our local device. This can be done using the following command.</p>
<pre><code>
  git clone https://github.com/Heborine/CS35L-Project.git
</code></pre>
